# Functions-Practice
1. Function with No Parameters
Simple clock system that logs the current date and time every time it is called. This function will not take any parameters.


2. Function with No Return Value
Basic logging system for an app. Every time a user performs an action, the system should record a log with a simple message. This function does not need to return anything; it simply logs the message.


3. Function with Multiple Parameters
Simple calculator app. The app allows users to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.


4. Physics Problem: Calculus-Based
Velocity calculator of an object given its initial velocity, acceleration, and time. 
formula kinematics: 
v(t) = vâ‚€ + at

5. Gaming Problem: Chess Knight Moves
The board is a standard 8x8 chessboard, where the coordinates range from (1,1) to (8,8). This means the bottom-left corner is (1,1), and the top-right corner is (8,8).

6. Arrow Function
A leaderboard for a game. You need a function to calculate the average score of players in a game round.

7. Practice Assigning Functions to Variables
List of tasks. Each task has a due date and a status. You want to create a simple to-do list system by assigning a function to a variable that will log whether a task is completed or not based on its status.


8. Practice Assigning Function Calls to Variables
Simple online store. You want to calculate the total cost of a shopping cart and store it in a variable.
